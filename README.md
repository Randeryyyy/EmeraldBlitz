# Key Features

## Roguelike Randomization
- **Randomized Gyms:** Gyms are randomized; upon entering a gym, you'll be warped to any gym at random. Leader teams are adjusted to your current strength.
- **Elite... Eight!?:** Battle Frontier Brains join the Elite Four for more diverse lineup of final bosses.

## Quality of Life Improvements
- **Pokemon Catalog:** The notebook on the player's desk now comes stocked with every Pokémon in the draft. Simply scroll through, select your Pokemon, and get racing.
- **Permanent Repel:** The Cleanse Tag now functions as a toggleable permanent repel.
- **Portable PC:** A PC in your bag, accessible from anywhere besides the Elite Four chambers.
- **Med Kit:** A key item Pokecenter in your bag, automatically registered when you enter the Elite Four.
- **Visible IVs:** When paused to view your Pokémon’s stats, press A to display their IVs.

## Built for Speed
- **Level Cap Candy:** Instantly jumps your Pokémon to the level it next learns a move, evolves, or hits the current cap (whichever of the three comes first). The evolution animation is shortened. Asking to learn a move only asks once, not twice.
- **Flygon Bike:** Flygon replaces the bike, able to hop up ledges, move over shallow water, leap over rocks and trees, and Fly with the press of a button.
- **Just the Good Stuff:** All plot, including events involving Team Aqua and Magma, Steven, Wally, and Scott have been removed. 
- **Polite Trainers:** Ordinary trainers no longer challenge any player they see. They can still be fought, however, if you interact with them.

## Difficulty Boosts
- **Nuzlocke Mechanics:** Your Pokémon can’t overlevel the most powerful Pokémon of the next major boss trainer. You can’t use items in battle.
- **Boosting Cap:** While a Pokemon's stats can still be debuffed to -6, a Pokemon's stat stage can never be raised beyond +1. You'll need to rely on more creative strategies than Dragon Dance sweeps to take down these bosses.
- **Updated Teams:** Gym leaders use more well-rounded teams, having bolstered their rosters with new Alolan, Hisuian, and Galarian members.
- **New Boss Fights:** The champion and final battle is now Steven Stone wielding a Mega Metagross. Wallace, meanwhile, now joins Juan to make the 8th gym a double battle.
- **Buffed Battles:** All enemy trainers use perfect 31-IV Pokémon.

## Reworked Shop
- **Fixed Money Supply:** Players are no longer able to sell items, and non-boss battles no longer award money. The player has 62,000 to spend, and every purchase has an opportunity cost.
- **Slateport Outdoor Market:** Most relevant items, including evolution stones, mega stones, power TMs, and ability-changing items are available for purchase in the Slateport outdoor market.
- **Purchasable Berries:** All easily accessible berries are available for sale 

## Modern Mechanics
- **Mega Evolution:** Mega Stones are here! Click `Fight` in battle and then press Start before selecting your move to mega evolve. Mega stones are one-time-use and consumed once used.
- **Fairy Types:** Fairy Type has been added to the game. Pokémon have had their typing and learnsets updated to generation VII.
- **Generation IX Pokémon and Items:** The auction pool includes Pokémon and items all the way up to additions from Pokémon Legends ZA.
- **Physical/Special Split:** Moves now calculate damage based on the split introduced in generation IV. Thunder Punch, for example, calculates its damage based on your Pokémon’s attack stat. In Emerald, it originally would have used the Special Attack stat, since Thunder Punch is an electric-type move.
- **Physical/Special Split:** TMs from generation 6 including Hone Claws, Dazzling Gleam, X-Scissor and Dark Pulse help even out coverage for your team.

## New Unique Tools
- **Milk Drink:** Skiddo and Mareep's Milk Drink can now be used in the overworld to increase a Pokemon's level by one, ignoring the level cap. Choose carefully--you can only use it once!
- **Forecast:** Castform's Forecast ability now sets rain, sun or hail depending on the type of the first move in its movelist.
- **Last Respects:** Last Respects' power is now determined by how many deaths you've had over the course of your run, gaining 30 Base Power each time a Pokemon faints. Your Houndstone only growws more powerful as its allies fall.
- **Seed Sower:** Arboliva's signiture ability now sets Leech Seed when an enemy Pokemon attacks it.
- **Undead Corsola:** Upon fainting, Corsola is revived at the end of the battle as Galarian Corsola.
- **Applin Evolution:** Applin's split evolution path is now determined by what gym you reach first: Fortree for Flapple, Lavaridge for Appletun, and Rustboro for Dipplin.
